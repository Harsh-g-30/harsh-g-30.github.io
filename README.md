This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work, skills, projects, and professional experience in Software Engineering, AI, and Data.

The website follows a minimal, modern, and recruiter-friendly design, focusing on clarity, performance, and real-world impact. It serves as a central place for recruiters and collaborators to explore my background and get in touch.
